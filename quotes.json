{"text": "The timeline might surprise you - Cleopatra, the last pharaoh of Egypt, lived around 2,500 years ago. However, the Great Pyramid of Giza was constructed around 4,500 years ago. That means Cleopatra lived closer to the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing than to the building of the ancient pyramid."},
{"text": "In a fire station in Livermore, California, there's a light bulb that has been burning since 1901. Known as the \"Centennial Light,\" this incandescent bulb has been illuminating its surroundings for over a century, making it one of the longest-lasting light bulbs in history."},
